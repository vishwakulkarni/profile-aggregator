# Profile aggregrator

  

## Project Summary
Our semester project will be about a website built over the need for accumulating profiles of all platforms and ease of access while applying for the job. We will be linking the profiles of a user from various platforms like (Linkedin, GitHub, Hackerrank, LeetCode etc) and provide a one-page view of all data which can be handy while applying for jobs. This will help in providing all data in one place and also come in handy with an easy copy of each data with just one click of a button.

We are trying to achieve ease of applying for any job, by providing all the information in one place. This will not only save your time but also help you organize everything at one place.
